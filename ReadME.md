Above is the drive link for the ML Classifier model

Currently there is no actual e-commerce structure to get e-waste from people to get it recycled on a large scale. The Sustainable store is an online platform where the users can earn points by giving out their E-waste to our store officials. The points earned can be used to buy recycled products from our website which is made from e-waste collected from our users. We have also used an ML model to classify if the given waste material is classified as E-waste or not which will help to raise awareness of waste recycling.
